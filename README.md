# DataCamp-Competition-Bee-friendly-plants
DataCamp competion in Python
You work for the local government environment agency and have taken on a project about creating pollinator bee-friendly spaces. You can use both native and non-native plants to create these spaces and therefore need to ensure that you use the correct plants to optimize the environment for these bees.

The team has collected data on native and non-native plants and their effects on pollinator bees. Your task will be to analyze this data and provide recommendations on which plants create an optimized environment for pollinator bees.
You have assembled information on the plants and bees research in a file called plants_and_bees.csv. Each row represents a sample that was taken from a patch of land where the plant species were being studied.

Challenge:
Provide your agency with a report that covers the following:
    Which plants are preferred by native vs non-native bee species?
    A visualization of the distribution of bee and plant species across one of the samples.
    Select the top three plant species you would recommend to the agency to support native bees.

    The dataset can be found on this site (data for this challenge has been modified by DataCamp)
